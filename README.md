# Quote of the Day
<p><em>... C++ offers even more flexible control over the visibility of member objects and member functions.  Specifically, members may be placed in the public, private, or protected parts of a class.  Members declared in the public parts are visible to all clients; members declared in the private parts are fully encapsulated; and members declared in the protected parts are visible only to the class itself and its subclasses.  C++ also supports the notion of *friends*: cooperative classes that are permitted to see each other's private parts.</em><br /> -- Grady Booch, "Object Oriented Design with Applications"</p>
