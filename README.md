# Quote of the Day
<p><em>Like my parents, I have never been a regular church member or churchgoer.  It doesn't seem plausible to me that there is the kind of God who watches over human affairs, listens to prayers, and tries to guide people to follow His precepts -- there is just too much misery and cruelty for that.  On the other hand, I respect and envy the people who get inspiration from their religions.</em><br /> -- Benjamin Spock</p>
