# Quote of the Day
<p><em>Listen, not a year goes by, not a year, that I don't hear about some escalator accident involving some bastard kid which could have easily been avoided had some parent - I don't care which one - but some parent conditioned him to fear and respect that escalator.</em><br /> -- Brodie Bruce</p>
