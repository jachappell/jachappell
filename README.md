# Quote of the Day
<p><em>So you got the fax. So why didn't you add it to the rÃ©sumÃ©? What do you mean? Of course, martial arts training is relevant. Oh, excuse me, I know about a billion Asians that would beg to differ. Yeah, I get a little frustrated when I'm dealing with incompetence! Well, you know what? You can go to hell, too, and I will see you there burning. Fine. Oh, wait, so you'll let me know when you've made a decision?</em><br /> -- Dwight Kurt Schrute III</p>
